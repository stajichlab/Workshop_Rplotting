## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cabbage_table, echo=FALSE}
kable(Sample.Data.Cabbages) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive", full_width = F))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r gettoknowyodata, echo=FALSE}
#look at each intersection of data
plot(Sample.Data.Cabbages)

#how many unique weights?
length(unique(Sample.Data.Cabbages$Head.Weight))

#how many samples are of the January King variety?
nrow(subset(Sample.Data.Cabbages, Sample.Data.Cabbages$Cultivar=="January King"))

#using the same formula how many unique "days to harvest" are there?


#what is the mean weight?
mean(Sample.Data.Cabbages$Head.Weight)

#what is the mean days to harvest for each variety?

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

plot(Sample.Data.Cabbages$Head.Weight, Sample.Data.Cabbages$Ascorbic.Acid, col = Sample.Data.Cabbages$Cultivar, pch = 16, cex = 2, main="Weights by Ascorbic Acid", xlab="Head Weight (Kg)", ylab="Ascorbic Acid (µg/g cabbage)")
#fix the legend position
legend(4, 70, 
       #check to make sure the dots are represented correctly
       legend = c("January King","Cannonball"),
       col = c(1:2),
       lty = "solid")

#hint
levels(Sample.Data.Cabbages$Cultivar)
```


```{r}
#Make the same figure but with ggplot
#ggplot(fill this in) + geom_point()+ xlab("Head Weight") + ylab("Ascorbic Acid µg/g Cabbage")+ guides(color=guide_legend(title="Cultivar"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
#add color and overlay data points

ggplot(Sample.Data.Cabbages, aes(Sample.Data.Cabbages$Cultivar, Sample.Data.Cabbages$Head.Weight)) + geom_boxplot() + stat_compare_means(method = "t.test")

CB_weight<-(subset(Sample.Data.Cabbages$Head.Weight, Sample.Data.Cabbages$Cultivar=="Cannonball"))
JK_weight<-(subset(Sample.Data.Cabbages$Head.Weight, Sample.Data.Cabbages$Cultivar=="January King"))
pval<-t.test(CB_weight,JK_weight)

boxplot(Sample.Data.Cabbages$Head.Weight~Sample.Data.Cabbages$Cultivar, data=Sample.Data.Cabbages, main="Cultivar Weights", xlab="Cultivars", ylab="Head Weight (Kg)")
text(1,1, pval$p.value)


```

```{r daytoharvest, echo=FALSE}

#Create a figure that would show the difference between time to harvest for each cultivar. 

```
